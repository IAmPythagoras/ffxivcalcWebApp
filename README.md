# ffxivcalcWebApp

FFXIVCALC is a web app made with electron/django that enables anyone to use the ffxivcalc python library to simulate combat from the game FFXIV Online. This app also has a gear solver (beta) that could let someone find (possibly) optimal gear composition given a rotation, a gear list, a food list, a materia list and other parameters of interest. You can download this app by going to this link (put link).
